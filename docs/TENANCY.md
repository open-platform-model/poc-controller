# Multi-Tenancy with opm-operator

## Audience

Platform administrators and operators running opm-operator in a shared cluster where multiple teams (tenants) author `ModuleRelease` and `Release` objects against pre-provisioned RBAC.

## Summary

opm-operator's tenancy boundary is the **Kubernetes namespace**. Per-tenant RBAC, not per-release RBAC, is the convention. One ServiceAccount and one RoleBinding per tenant namespace; every release in that namespace references the same SA via `spec.serviceAccountName`. This matches the Flux [multi-tenancy pattern](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/multitenancy/) and is the smallest primitive that stays safe without admission plugins.

## Recommended pattern: one SA per tenant namespace

For each tenant namespace:

1. Create the namespace.
2. Create one ServiceAccount (example: `opm-deployer`).
3. Create one RoleBinding (or ClusterRoleBinding scoped to the namespace) granting that SA exactly the verbs modules in this namespace are allowed to apply.
4. Reference the SA from every `ModuleRelease` / `Release` via `spec.serviceAccountName`.

The controller's own RBAC stays narrow: `get` + `impersonate` on `serviceaccounts` only. Workload writes happen through impersonation; the tenant SA's RBAC determines what may be applied.

## Worked example: two ModuleReleases sharing one SA

Platform admin provisions the SA and binding once per tenant namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: team-a
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: opm-deployer
  namespace: team-a
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: opm-deployer
  namespace: team-a
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: edit
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: opm-deployer
    namespace: team-a
```

> **Warning:** `edit` is shown for brevity. In production, bind to a narrower custom ClusterRole that lists exactly the GVKs your modules render. Avoid `admin` and any role that includes `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` verbs unless modules are trusted to author RBAC.

Tenant writes any number of releases against that SA:

```yaml
apiVersion: releases.opmodel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleRelease
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  module:
    path: opmodel.dev/team-a/frontend
    version: v1.2.0
  serviceAccountName: opm-deployer
  prune: true
  values:
    replicas: 3
---
apiVersion: releases.opmodel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleRelease
metadata:
  name: worker
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  module:
    path: opmodel.dev/team-a/worker
    version: v0.5.1
  serviceAccountName: opm-deployer
  prune: true
```

Both releases impersonate `system:serviceaccount:team-a:opm-deployer` when applying. RBAC is authored at tenancy granularity, not release granularity.

## Lockdown: `--default-service-account`

For clusters where every release should be impersonated — no controller-identity fallback — start the manager with `--default-service-account`:

```bash
opm-operator --default-service-account=opm-deployer
```

Semantics:

| Situation | Effective identity |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `spec.serviceAccountName` non-empty | The named SA (flag ignored). |
| `spec.serviceAccountName` empty, flag empty | Controller's own identity (default, narrow RBAC). |
| `spec.serviceAccountName` empty, flag non-empty | `system:serviceaccount:<releaseNamespace>:<flag-value>`. |

The SA named by the flag must exist in **each** tenant namespace. It is never resolved cross-namespace — an SA with the same name in the controller's namespace does not satisfy a release in a tenant namespace.

If the flag-defaulted SA is missing, the reconcile stalls:

| Condition | Status | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `Ready` | `False` | `ImpersonationFailed` |
| `Stalled` | `True` | `ImpersonationFailed` |

### Pick an explicit flag value

Use something explicit like `opm-deployer`. The built-in `default` SA has no RBAC, so `--default-service-account=default` will cause every empty-SA release to fail `forbidden` — a predictable lockdown, but only intentional if that is what you want.

### Conventional provisioning

A bootstrap tool (Argo, Flux, Terraform, `kustomize`) that creates tenant namespaces should also create the flag-named SA and its RoleBinding. Drift in the convention surfaces as `ImpersonationFailed` on the first release in an under-provisioned namespace.

### Deletion cleanup

Finalizer-driven deletion cleanup follows the same `spec.serviceAccountName > --default-service-account > controller client` resolution as apply and prune — a release with empty spec + a manager flag prunes inventory under the flag-defaulted identity.

If the resolved SA is missing at deletion time (for example, the SA was deleted before the release — classic `kubectl delete -f` race against a bundled SA), the controller does **not** fall back to its own client. Instead the release stalls:

| Condition | Status | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `Ready` | `False` | `DeletionSAMissing` |
| `Stalled` | `True` | `DeletionSAMissing` |

The finalizer is retained, a `Warning` event (`DeletionSAMissing`) is emitted once on the transition, and the reconcile requeues on the stalled-recheck interval.

### Recovering a release stuck on `DeletionSAMissing`

Three operator actions, in order of preference:

1. **Restore the ServiceAccount and its RBAC.** The next reconcile impersonates successfully, prunes the inventory, and removes the finalizer.
2. **Patch `spec.prune=false`.** The controller orphans managed resources without attempting impersonation and removes the finalizer.
3. **Set annotation `opm.dev/force-delete-orphan=true`.** Break-glass only. The controller:
   - Skips prune entirely.
   - Clears `status.inventory` in the final status patch.
   - Emits a `Warning` event (`OrphanedOnDeletion`) naming the orphaned entry count so the leak is auditable.
   - Removes the finalizer.

   The managed resources remain in the cluster; cleaning them up is the operator's responsibility.

   Any annotation value other than the literal string `"true"` is treated as absent. This prevents typos from releasing the finalizer.

```bash
kubectl annotate modulerelease <name> \
  opm.dev/force-delete-orphan=true
```

Other impersonation errors on the deletion path (transient API errors, controller lacks `impersonate`, target RBAC denies `impersonate`) keep the existing `ImpersonationFailed` stall. The orphan annotation has no effect on those cases — it is narrowly scoped to SA-NotFound.

## Security note

ServiceAccount impersonation shifts the privilege boundary onto *which SA a release may reference*. If a privileged SA (one bound to `cluster-admin`, or to any `system:*` role) exists in a tenant namespace, any tenant who can create a release in that namespace can cause the controller to apply arbitrary resources under that identity. The controller enforces same-namespace SA references, but it does not police the target SA's bindings.

Read [`docs/design/impersonation-and-privilege-escalation.md`](design/impersonation-and-privilege-escalation.md) — the threat model section describes the escalation gadget in full. The `--default-service-account` flag narrows the fallback surface but does not close this gadget; it is still possible to misplace a privileged SA in a tenant namespace.

Rules of thumb:

- Never place a `cluster-admin`-bound SA in a tenant namespace.
- Audit every `RoleBinding` whose subject is the tenancy SA.
- Prefer custom namespace-scoped Roles over `edit`/`admin` ClusterRoles when the rendered GVK set is known.
- Treat the tenant-SA permissions as a tenant's maximum blast radius. If that radius is too large, narrow the SA's binding, not the controller.
