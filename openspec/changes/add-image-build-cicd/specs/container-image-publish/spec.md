## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Image registry and repository

The CI pipeline SHALL publish the controller manager container image to `ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator`. No other registry or repository path is used by this capability.

#### Scenario: PR build push target
- **WHEN** the PR image workflow builds and pushes an image
- **THEN** the image reference SHALL begin with `ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator:`

#### Scenario: Release build push target
- **WHEN** the release image job builds and pushes an image
- **THEN** the image reference SHALL begin with `ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator:`

### Requirement: Pull-request image build trigger and tags

The PR image workflow SHALL run on `pull_request` events (types: `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`) that touch any path affecting the produced image. On every run it SHALL build and push exactly two tags: `:sha-<short>` where `<short>` is the 7-character short commit SHA of the PR head, and `:pr-<PR_ID>` where `<PR_ID>` is the GitHub pull request number. The `:pr-<PR_ID>` tag MAY be overwritten by subsequent pushes to the same PR; `:sha-<short>` is effectively immutable because the SHA changes when the commit changes.

#### Scenario: New PR opened
- **WHEN** a contributor opens a pull request whose head commit is `abcd123...`
- **THEN** the workflow SHALL push `ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator:sha-abcd123` and `ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator:pr-<PR_ID>`

#### Scenario: Force push updates an open PR
- **WHEN** a contributor force-pushes a new head commit `ef01234...` to an existing PR with `PR_ID=42`
- **THEN** the workflow SHALL push `:sha-ef01234` as a new tag AND overwrite `:pr-42` to point at the new image

#### Scenario: Non-applicable event
- **WHEN** a comment-only or label-only event fires on a pull request (without code changes)
- **THEN** the workflow SHALL NOT run an image build

### Requirement: Release image build trigger gated on release-please

The release image job SHALL only execute when the `release-please` job in the same workflow run reports `outputs.releases_created == 'true'`. When a Release PR is opened or updated without a release being cut, the image job SHALL be skipped.

#### Scenario: Release cut after merge of Release PR
- **WHEN** a push to `main` causes release-please to tag version `v1.2.3` and create a GitHub release
- **THEN** the image-release job SHALL run and publish the image

#### Scenario: Push to main opens or updates a Release PR only
- **WHEN** a push to `main` causes release-please to open or update a Release PR (but not cut a release)
- **THEN** the image-release job SHALL be skipped and its status SHALL be reported as skipped (not failed) in the GitHub Actions UI

#### Scenario: Push to main with no releasable commits
- **WHEN** a push to `main` contains only `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, or `refactor` commits and release-please takes no action
- **THEN** the image-release job SHALL be skipped

### Requirement: Release image tags

On a gated release run, the image-release job SHALL push exactly three tags for a release version `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`: `:sha-<short>` (7-character short SHA of the release commit), `:v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (exact release version including leading `v`), and `:latest`.

#### Scenario: First release v0.1.0
- **WHEN** release-please cuts `v0.1.0` at commit `abcd123...`
- **THEN** the job SHALL push `:sha-abcd123`, `:v0.1.0`, and `:latest` all pointing at the same manifest list

#### Scenario: Subsequent release v0.2.0
- **WHEN** release-please cuts `v0.2.0` at commit `ef01234...`
- **THEN** the job SHALL push `:sha-ef01234`, `:v0.2.0`, and update `:latest` to point at the new manifest list

### Requirement: Multi-architecture support

PR image builds SHALL produce a single-architecture image for `linux/amd64` only. Release image builds SHALL produce a multi-architecture manifest list covering `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/s390x`, and `linux/ppc64le`.

#### Scenario: PR build architecture set
- **WHEN** the PR image workflow runs
- **THEN** the resulting pushed image SHALL expose exactly one platform descriptor: `linux/amd64`

#### Scenario: Release build architecture set
- **WHEN** the release image-release job runs successfully
- **THEN** the resulting pushed manifest list SHALL expose exactly four platform descriptors: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/s390x`, and `linux/ppc64le`

### Requirement: Cosign keyless signatures

Every image manifest pushed by either the PR or release workflow SHALL be signed with cosign using Sigstore's keyless OIDC flow (Fulcio-issued certificate, Rekor transparency log entry). No long-lived cosign private key is stored in the repository or in GitHub secrets.

#### Scenario: PR image signature
- **WHEN** the PR image workflow successfully pushes an image
- **THEN** a cosign signature keyed by the image's SHA256 digest SHALL be published alongside the image in GHCR AND a Rekor transparency log entry SHALL exist referencing the GitHub Actions OIDC token

#### Scenario: Release image signature
- **WHEN** the release image-release job successfully pushes a manifest list
- **THEN** a cosign signature SHALL be published for the manifest list digest

#### Scenario: Signature verification recipe
- **WHEN** a consumer runs `cosign verify` against a release image with the repository's documented `--certificate-identity-regexp` and `--certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- **THEN** verification SHALL succeed for images produced by the release workflow

### Requirement: SBOM and SLSA provenance on release builds

Release image-release job SHALL attach, in addition to the cosign signature, an SPDX-JSON software bill of materials and a SLSA build provenance attestation for the manifest list digest. PR image builds SHALL NOT produce SBOM or provenance attestations (signature only).

#### Scenario: Release SBOM attached
- **WHEN** the release image-release job completes successfully
- **THEN** an SPDX-JSON SBOM attestation SHALL be discoverable via `cosign download attestation` against the manifest-list digest

#### Scenario: Release provenance attached
- **WHEN** the release image-release job completes successfully
- **THEN** a SLSA provenance predicate SHALL be discoverable via the repository's attestations UI AND via `cosign download attestation`

#### Scenario: PR builds omit heavy attestations
- **WHEN** the PR image workflow completes successfully
- **THEN** no SBOM or SLSA provenance attestation SHALL be generated for the PR image

### Requirement: Release install manifest with digest-pinned image

On a gated release run, the image-release job SHALL invoke `task build:installer IMG="ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator:v<VERSION>@sha256:<DIGEST>"` where `<DIGEST>` is the manifest-list digest returned by the push step, render `dist/install.yaml`, and upload that file as an asset on the GitHub release created by release-please. The existing `task build:installer` target SHALL remain unchanged in behavior and its default invocation (no `IMG` override) SHALL still produce a manifest using `controller:latest`.

#### Scenario: Release asset upload
- **WHEN** the image-release job finishes building and signing `v1.2.3` at digest `sha256:abc...`
- **THEN** `dist/install.yaml` SHALL be rendered with image references pinned to `ghcr.io/open-platform-model/opm-operator:v1.2.3@sha256:abc...` AND the file SHALL be uploaded as an asset on the GitHub release tagged `v1.2.3`

#### Scenario: Default build-installer unchanged
- **WHEN** a developer runs `task build:installer` locally without an `IMG` override
- **THEN** the rendered `dist/install.yaml` SHALL continue to reference `controller:latest` as before this change

#### Scenario: Install manifest image is immutable
- **WHEN** a consumer downloads the release-attached `dist/install.yaml` and runs `kubectl apply -f install.yaml`
- **THEN** the controller Deployment SHALL pull the image by digest, guaranteeing the exact bytes from the release regardless of future tag movement

### Requirement: Workflow permissions and action pinning

The PR image workflow and the release image-release job SHALL declare the minimal permissions required: `contents: read` (`contents: write` on the release job only, to upload release assets), `packages: write`, `id-token: write`, and `attestations: write` (release job only). All third-party GitHub Actions SHALL be pinned by full commit SHA, not by floating tag.

#### Scenario: PR workflow permissions
- **WHEN** the PR image workflow is defined
- **THEN** it SHALL declare `contents: read`, `packages: write`, and `id-token: write` (no `attestations: write`, no `contents: write`)

#### Scenario: Release job permissions
- **WHEN** the image-release job is defined
- **THEN** it SHALL declare `contents: write`, `packages: write`, `id-token: write`, and `attestations: write`

#### Scenario: Action pinning
- **WHEN** any third-party action is referenced in the PR workflow or the image-release job
- **THEN** it SHALL be referenced by a 40-character commit SHA, never by `@v1`, `@v5`, `@main`, or any other floating ref
