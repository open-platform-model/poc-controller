## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Full reconcile loop execution
The `ModuleReleaseReconciler` MUST execute phases 0-7 sequentially when a ModuleRelease is reconciled.

#### Scenario: First successful reconcile
- **WHEN** a ModuleRelease is created with a valid sourceRef and the OCIRepository is ready
- **THEN** the controller resolves the source, fetches the artifact, renders resources, applies them via SSA, updates status with conditions/digests/inventory/history, and sets `Ready=True`

#### Scenario: Source not yet ready
- **WHEN** the referenced OCIRepository exists but is not ready
- **THEN** the controller sets `SourceReady=False`, `Ready=Unknown`, `Reconciling=True`, and waits for a source event

#### Scenario: Render failure
- **WHEN** the CUE module fails to evaluate (e.g., invalid values)
- **THEN** the controller sets `Ready=False`, `Stalled=True` with reason `RenderFailed`, and does NOT modify inventory or attempt apply

#### Scenario: Apply failure
- **WHEN** SSA apply fails (e.g., API server error)
- **THEN** the controller sets `Ready=False` with reason `ApplyFailed`, does NOT prune, and does NOT update `lastApplied*` digests

### Requirement: Suspend check
The reconciler MUST skip reconciliation when `spec.suspend` is true.

#### Scenario: Suspended release
- **WHEN** `spec.suspend` is true
- **THEN** the controller sets condition reason `Suspended` and returns without requeue

### Requirement: No-op detection
The reconciler MUST detect no-op reconciliations and skip apply/prune when nothing changed.

#### Scenario: All digests match
- **WHEN** source, config, render, and inventory digests all match the last applied values
- **THEN** the controller skips apply and prune, keeps `Ready=True`, and does not record a new history entry

### Requirement: Outcome classification
The reconciler MUST classify each reconcile attempt as one of: `NoOp`, `Applied`, `AppliedAndPruned`, `FailedTransient`, `FailedStalled`.

#### Scenario: Transient failure requeues with explicit backoff
- **WHEN** the outcome is `FailedTransient`
- **THEN** the controller returns `ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: backoff}` with nil error, where backoff is computed from `failureCounters.reconcile`

#### Scenario: Stalled failure requeues with safety interval
- **WHEN** the outcome is `FailedStalled`
- **THEN** the controller returns `ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: 30m}` with nil error

### Requirement: Status always patched
The reconciler MUST patch `ModuleRelease.status` at the end of every reconcile attempt that produces a meaningful state change. The reconciler MUST NOT patch status when the outcome is `NoOp` and no state has changed.

#### Scenario: Status updated on failure
- **WHEN** a phase fails
- **THEN** status conditions, `lastAttempted*` fields, and `nextRetryAt` are updated

#### Scenario: Status skip on no-op
- **WHEN** the outcome is `NoOp`
- **THEN** no status patch is issued (generation predicate prevents the resulting watch event from mattering, and skipping the patch avoids unnecessary API calls)

### Requirement: Inventory updated only on full success
The `status.inventory` MUST only be replaced after a fully successful apply (and prune, if enabled).

#### Scenario: Partial failure preserves inventory
- **WHEN** apply succeeds but prune fails
- **THEN** `status.inventory` remains at the previous successful value

### Requirement: Temp directory cleanup
The reconciler MUST clean up any temporary directories used for artifact extraction, even on error.

#### Scenario: Cleanup on error
- **WHEN** a phase fails after artifact extraction
- **THEN** the temp directory is removed via deferred cleanup
